# Synobuild
The following is for a Synology Diskstation only. Modify accordingly for your own NAS or NFS server setup.
Prerequisites are:
- [x] Synology Static IP Address is `192.168.1.10`
- [x] Synology Hostname is `cyclone-01`
- [x] Synology Gateway is `192.168.1.5`
- [x] Synology DNS Server is `192.168.1.5`

Tasks to be performed are:
- [ ] Create the required Synology shared folders and NFS shares
- [ ] Create a new user group `homelab`
- [ ] Create two new Synology users;
  * first user named: `storm`
  * second user named: `gituser`
- [ ] Configure Synology NAS SSH Key-based authentication for the above users.

## Create the required Synology Shared Folders and NFS Shares
### Create Shared Folders
We need the following shared folder tree, in addition to your standard default tree, on the Synology NAS:
```
Synology NAS/
│
└──  volume1/
    ├── backup
    ├── docker
    ├── download
    ├── music 
    ├── openvpn
    ├── photo 
    ├── pxe
    ├── ssh_key
    ├── video
    ├── virtualbox
    └── proxmox
```
To create shared folders log in to the Synology Desktop and:
1. Open `Control Panel` > `Shared Folder` > `Create`.
2. Set up basic information:
   * Name: `"i.e backup"`
   * Description: `"leave blank if you want"`
   * Location: `Volume 1`
   * Hide this shared ...: ☐ 
   * Hide sub-folders ...: ☐ 
   * Enable Recycle Bin:
     * backup ☑
     * docker ☑
     * download ☐ 
     * music ☑
     * openvpn ☑
     * photo ☑
     * pxe ☑
     * ssh_key ☑
     * video ☐ 
     * virtualbox ☑
     * proxmox ☑
3. Set up Encryption:
     * Encrypt this shared folder: ☐ 
4. Set up advanced:
   * All disabled:  ☐ 
5. Set up Permissions:
     * Note, at this point do not flag anything, just hit `Cancel` to exit.
     
## Set up NFS Permissions
Create NFS shares for all of the above folders. 
1. Log in to the Synology Desktop and go to `Control Panel` > `Shared Folder` > `Select a Folder` > `Edit` > `NFS Permissions` > `Create `
2. Set NFS rule options as follows:
   * Hostname or IP*: `"192.168.1.0/24"`
   * Privilege: `Read/Write`
   * Squash: `Map all users to admin`
   * Security: `auth_sys`
     * Enable asynchronous:  ☑
     * Allow connections from non-privileged ports:  ☑
     * Allow users to access mounted subfolders:  ☑
3. Repeat steps 1 to 2 for all of the above folders BUT NOT `ssh_key` folder.

## Create new Synology User group
To create a new group log in to the Synology Desktop and:
1. Open `Control Panel` > `Group` > `Create`
2. Set User Information as follows:
   * Name: `"homelab"`
   * Description: `"Homelab Server group"`
3. Assign shared folders permissions as follows:
Note: Any private data you may have stored in a shared folder simply assign `No Access` to the `homelab` group.

| Name | No access | Read/Write | Read Only |

5. Assign application permissions:

| Name | Allow | Deny |
| :---  | :---: | :---: |
| `DSM` | ☐ | ☑ |  
| `Drive` | ☐ | ☑ |
